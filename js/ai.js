## Core Planner Features

- [x] A completed task


### Scheduling
Add a specific date to any item to make it appear in all relevant planner views (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Future Log).

**Syntax:** (SCHEDULED: YYYY-MM-DD)
*You can optionally add a time, like HH:mm.*

**Example:**

### Repeating Events
Create recurring events that will automatically appear on the correct days using the (REPEAT: rule) syntax. This is perfect for habits, chores, birthdays, and appointments.

**Syntax:** (REPEAT: rule)

---
#### **Supported Rules**

##### **1. Interval-Based Rules**
These are for events that repeat on a flexible schedule. The starting point is determined by the (SCHEDULED: ...) date on the same line. If no scheduled date is present, it starts from today.

*   **Syntax:** (REPEAT: every [number] [unit])
    *   **Units:** days, weeks, months, years

*   **Examples:**
    
    - Water the plants (REPEAT: every 3 days)
    - Team meeting (SCHEDULED: 2025-07-15) (REPEAT: every 2 weeks)
    - Review monthly finances (REPEAT: every 1 month)
    - Yearly subscription renewal (SCHEDULED: 2025-08-01) (REPEAT: every 1 year)
    

*   **With a Date Range:** You can also constrain these rules to a specific period.
    *   **Syntax:** (REPEAT: every [number] [unit] from YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD)
    *   **Example:**
        
        - Daily project stand-up (REPEAT: every 1 day from 2025-10-01 to 2025-10-31)
        

##### **2. Weekly Rules**
For events tied to a specific day of the week.

*   **Syntax:** (REPEAT: every [weekday])
    *   **Weekday:** monday, tuesday, wednesday, etc.

*   **Examples:**
    
    - Take out the trash (REPEAT: every sunday)
    - Submit weekly report (REPEAT: every friday)
    
*   You can also add a from...to... date range to these rules, just like with intervals.

##### **3. Daily Rules**
A simple rule for things that happen every single day.

*   **Syntax:** (REPEAT: everyday)

*   **Example:**
    
    - Morning meditation (REPEAT: everyday)
    
*   This can also be combined with a from...to... date range.

##### **4. Annual Rules**
Perfect for birthdays, anniversaries, and yearly holidays.

*   **Syntax:** (REPEAT: YYYY-MM-DD) or (REPEAT: DD.MM) or (REPEAT: DD/MM)

*   **Examples:**
    
    - Mom's Birthday (REPEAT: 1950-09-05)
    - Anniversary (REPEAT: 22.10)
    
### Push Notifications
Set a browser notification for any task or event. You must grant notification permissions in your browser settings first.

**Syntax:** (NOTIFY: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm)
*The time is required for notifications.*

**Example:**

- [ ] Dentist appointment (NOTIFY: 2025-07-20 09:00)

## Wiki-Style Linking

Connect your notes together to build a personal knowledge base.

**Syntax:** [[Page Title]]

**How it works:**
This creates a link to a page named "Page Title". If the page doesn't exist, clicking the link will create it. On the destination page, a "Linked Mentions" section will appear, showing you every page that links back to it.

**Example:**

My thoughts on [[Stoicism]] are evolving. It connects well with my [[2025 Reading List]].
